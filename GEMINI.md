# Gemini CLI Workspace Instructions

This file contains foundational mandates for the Gemini CLI agent in this repository.

## Development Standards
- **Planning**: Before implementing any code changes, you MUST provide a concise summary of your strategy and wait for user approval.
- **Language**: All code changes, commit messages, inline comments, and logs within the codebase MUST be in **English**.
- **Commit Messages**: Commit messages should include a concise title and a detailed description of the changes (the "what" and "why").
- **Build Process**: After making any modifications to the source code, the agent should proactively run `npm run build` to ensure the `dist` directory is up to date.

## Contextual Precedence
These instructions take absolute precedence over general defaults. Always verify adherence to these rules during the Strategy and Execution phases.
